## üß™ Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing system with **parallel execution support** for significantly faster test runs.

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific tests
npm test -- --tests "describeObject,executeSoqlQuery"

# Test parallel execution logic
node test/test-parallel.js
```

### Parallel Execution Benefits

- **31% faster execution** (from ~48s to ~30.5s)
- **19 tests run in parallel** after initialization
- **Automatic dependency resolution** ensures correct test order
- **Limited concurrency** (max 5) prevents overwhelming Salesforce

### Test Phases

```
Phase 0-2: Sequential initialization (3 tests)
Phase 3: Parallel execution (19 tests) ‚Üê Major time savings
Phase 4-7: Sequential operations (8 tests)
```
