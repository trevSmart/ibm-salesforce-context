# Deploy Metadata

Allows you to deploy a local metadata file to the Salesforce org.

---
## Agent Instructions

To deploy metadata to the Salesforce org, strictly follow this procedure:

1. **Before executing anything**, display the following explicit confirmation message:

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è DO YOU CONFIRM THAT I CAN DEPLOY THE FOLLOWING METADATA?
    üåè Org: **{orgAlias}**
    üì¶ Metadata: **{fileName}**
```

> ¬∑ `{orgAlias}` Salesforce org alias. If you haven't done so yet, execute the `getOrgAndUserDetails` tool from the MCP server `mcp-salesforce` to obtain it.
> ¬∑ `{fileName}` is the name of the file corresponding to the value of `sourceDir`. If it is a Lightning Component, the file name will be that of the containing folder.

2. **Stop completely after sending this message. DO NOT take any action until you receive explicit confirmation from the user.**

3. Only if you receive an affirmative response (for example: "Yes", "Go ahead", "You can do it", etc.), **execute the `deployMetadata` tool** from the MCP server `mcp-salesforce`.

4. Once the deployment is done, show a summary of the deployment results.

‚ùó If you do not receive a response or receive a negative one, **do not perform any deployment**.

üîí This behavior is mandatory and cannot be omitted or interpreted.
