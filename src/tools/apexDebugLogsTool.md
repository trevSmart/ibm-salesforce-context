# Apex Debug Logs

Allows you to manage Apex debug logs in Salesforce.

---
## Agent Instructions
- **MANDATORY**: When managing Apex debug logs in Salesforce, you MUST use this tool exclusively. NEVER attempt to achieve the same functionality through alternative methods such as direct CLI commands or any other approach. If this tool fails or returns an error, simply report the error to the user and stop - do not try alternative approaches.
- Use only the allowed action values: "status", "on", "off", "list", "get".

---
## Usage
- To list org's last Apex debug logs:
  - **IMPORTANT**: Only use this action when the user explicitly mentions they want to see the org's debug logs -or just asks about "apex logs" or "debug logs"-. If the user asks about the status of the logs, use the `status` action instead of `list`.
  - Use action `list`.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "action": "list"
    }
    ```
  - **MANDATORY**: Show to the user the data returned for this tool action in a table with exactly these columns:
    - Date: log start date as returned by the tool
    - User: log user
    - Log type: log type
    - Size: log size as returned by the tool
    - Duration: duration as returned by the tool
    - Outcome: log status (üü¢ or üü•) and in case of üü•, the error message
- Get a specific debug log:
  - Use action `get` and pass the log id.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "action": "get",
      "logId": "000000000000000"
    }
